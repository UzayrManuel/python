# Python

This repository contains my Python learning journey, with a focus on building strong fundamentals through hands-on practice.

The goal of this repository is to reinforce understanding through small, practical projects rather than large, copied examples.

---

## 🧠 What This Repository Focuses On
- Python fundamentals
- Writing clean, readable beginner-level code
- Problem-solving and logical thinking
- Iterating on projects to improve structure and flow
- Building confidence through small, finished programs

---

## 📌 Beginner Projects
The `beginner-projects` folder contains small Python programs such as:
- A basic calculator
- A number guessing game
- Other introductory projects as I continue learning

Each project is built from scratch and refined through debugging and iteration.

## 🚀 Future Plans
As I progress, this repository may expand to include:
- Automation scripts
- Networking-related Python tools
- Cybersecurity-related practice projects

---

This repository is a work in progress and reflects my learning and growth over time.
